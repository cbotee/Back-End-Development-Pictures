# Pictures REST API

## This repository contains Pictures REST API

The Pictures REST API is designed to facilitate the management and retrieval of image resources over the web. It typically provides endpoints that allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on images. Here's a brief description of what such an API might offer:

**GET** _/pictures_: Retrieve a list of all available pictures. This endpoint might support query parameters for filtering, sorting, or paginating the images.


**GET** _/pictures/{id}_: Retrieve a specific picture by its unique identifier. This returns the image data, possibly along with metadata like title, description, and upload date.


**POST** _/pictures_: Upload a new picture to the server. This endpoint usually requires the image file and may accept additional metadata in the request body.


**PUT** _/pictures/{id}_: Update an existing picture's metadata. This could include changing the title or description, but typically not the image file itself.**


**DELETE** _/pictures/{id}_: Remove a specific picture from the server. This operation deletes the image and its associated metadata.


The API typically uses standard HTTP methods and status codes to communicate success or failure of requests, and the data is often exchanged in JSON format. Authentication and authorization mechanisms may be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain operations.
